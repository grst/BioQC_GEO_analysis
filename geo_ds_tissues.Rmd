Apply BioQC on samples with tissues annotated
=============================================

Of ~4500 GEO-Datasets, 1183 have a tissue type annoated. 
We will first get an overview over the abundance of the respective tissues, so that we can choose the top $n$ tissues on which we can then perform the contamination analysis.

We then intend to merge all samples from one tissue into an expression set and then apply BioQC each of them.
