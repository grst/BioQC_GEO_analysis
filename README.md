# A prevalence of tissue heterogeneity in gene expression studies

See [grst/bioqc_geo](https://github.com/grst/bioqc_geo) or [grst.github.io/bioqc_geo](https://grst.github.io/bioqc_geo) for mor details. 

## Purpose of this repository
Unlike [grst/bioqc_geo](https://github.com/grst/bioqc_geo), which provides the results as a reproducible pipeline, 
this repository holds additional, internal code that are of minor relevance for the reader of the paper. 

In particluar, this repository documents how to download and process all gene expression studies from 
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), how to preprocess the samples and run BioQC on them. 

Check out the Makefile for more details.
