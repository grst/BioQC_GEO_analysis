# BioQC GEO Analysis

Systematically testing the GEO for *tissue heterogeneity*.

## The Experiment in brief

We take all samples from GEO which have the required annotation. We run BioQC on each of the samples. 
We compare the tissue predicted by BioQC with the annotated tissue and call a sample 'contamined' 
if the prediction does not match the annotation.
